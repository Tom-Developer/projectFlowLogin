<div id="service-terms" class="simple-overlay">
	<h1>ProjectFlow Terms of Service</h1><br />
	<p>
		Thank you for using ProjectFlow. These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to
		and use of ProjectFlow (“we” or “our”) websites and services (the “Services”), so please
		carefully read them before using the Services.
	</p><br />
	<p>
		By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on
		behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising
		that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, “you” and
		“your” will refer to that organization.
	</p><br />
	<p>
		You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may use the Services only
		if you have the power to form a contract with iLocality and are not barred under any
		applicable laws from doing so. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine
		and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior
		notice to you. We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Your Stuff & Your Privacy</h1><br />
	<p>
		By using our Services you provide us with information, descriptions, financial information and
		other data that you submit to ProjectFlow (together, “your stuff”). You retain full ownership
		to your stuff. We don’t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any
		rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed
		to run the Services, as explained below.
	</p><br />
	<p>
		We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example,
		hosting your data, or sharing them at your discretion. This includes product features visible
		to you. It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for
		example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need
		to do those things solely to provide the Services. This permission also extends to trusted
		third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example Amazon, which provides our
		storage space (again, only to provide the Services).
	</p><br />
	<p>
		To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how
		the Services change, we won’t share your content with others, including law enforcement, for
		any purpose unless you direct us to. How we collect and use your information generally is also
		explained in our Privacy Policy.
	</p><br />
	<p>
		You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your data, and your communications
		with others while using the Services. For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you
		have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.
	</p><br />
	<p>
		We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you
		acknowledge that iLocality has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services.
		We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files,
		user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Account Security</h1><br />
	<p>
		You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and
		you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for any
		activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should
		immediately notify iLocality of any unauthorized use of your account.
	</p><br />
	<h1>iLocality Property and Feedback</h1><br />
	<p>
		These terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, Software, or
		the content in the Services. While we appreciate it when users send us feedback, please be
		aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post in our
		forums without any obligation to you. The Software and other technology we use to provide
		the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States
		and foreign countries. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the iLocality trademarks,
		logos, domain names, or other brand features.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1><br />
	<p>
		You will not, and will not attempt to, misuse the Services, and will use the Services only
		in a manner consistent with the iLocality acceptable use policies.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Other Content</h1><br />
	<p>
		The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. iLocality does not
		endorse and is not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, the related content,
		products, or services. You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources.
		Also, if we provide you with any software under an open source license, there may be provisions
		in those licenses that expressly conflict with these Terms, in which case the open source
		provisions will apply.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Termination</h1><br />
	<p>
		Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any time. We reserve the
		right to suspend or end the Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without
		notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these
		Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’
		use of the Services. If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in
		advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly
		or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may
		suspend immediately.
	</p><br />
	<h1>ProjectFlow is Available AS-IS</h1><br />
	<p>
		Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service we can’t
		promise. For example, THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT
		EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF
		MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. (We are not shouting-
		it’s just that these disclaimers are really important, so we want to highlight them). iLocality
		will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or
		other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software. Some states and
		countries do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Limitation of Liability</h1><br />
	<p>
		TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL iLOCALITY, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS,
		EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
		PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS)
		DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT iLOCALITY HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE
		POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE
		LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS
		PAID BY YOU TO iLOCALITY FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some states and
		countries do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Modifications</h1><br />
	<p>
		We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted
		on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we may notify you
		(for example via email to the email address associated with your account). By continuing to
		access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the
		revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.
	</p><br />
	<h1>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h1><br />
	<p>
		THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY ONTARIO LAW EXCEPT
		FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR
		THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF
		OTTAWA, ONTARIO, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE. These
		Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and iLocality with respect to
		the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable
		to the Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. iLocality’s failure to
		enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found
		unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an
		enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may
		not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but iLocality may
		assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest
		of any business associated with the Services. iLocality and you are not legal partners or
		agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.
